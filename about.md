  Hi, I'm Willâ€”a Product Designer based in New York. For the past decade, I've
  created digital products, design systems, and web experiences for a range of
  startups, brands, and technology companies. 


  I've been at Meta since 2022, where I work on our monetization tools for creators and businesses across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Before that, I held a Design Lead position at Free Association, a Brooklyn-based design firm specializing in digital products and brand systems.
