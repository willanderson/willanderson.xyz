  Hi, I'm Willâ€”a Product Designer based in New York. For the past decade, I've
  created apps, digital products, and websites for a range of startups, brands,
  and technology companies. 


  I've been at Meta since 2022, where I work on our monetization tools for professionals across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Before that, I held a Design Lead position at Free Association, a Brooklyn-based design firm specializing in digital products and brand systems.

  - title: About this site
    content: >-
      I designed and built this site over a few months in 2023. The site is
      built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator,
      and itâ€™s hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
      (though I am also using AWS to host some of the larger assets). I use
      [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy the site, and [Decap
      CMS](https://decapcms.org/docs/intro/) to manage its contents.


      There's very little custom CSS. For the most part, I rely on [Tailwinds](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and responsive layouts. Thereâ€™s a tiny bit of JavaScript that [ChatGBT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) helped me with (Thanks babe ðŸ˜˜). 


      The site is basically free to run, and pretty easy to update and maintain. For anyone looking to follow a similar approach, here are two guides that proved very helpful:
