intro: >-
  Denim was an entirely new category for Everlane, and one of the most ambitious
  product launches I was involved in. The product took more than 2 years to
  develop, and tis release involved 4-months of planning and production to
  execute. 


  For the campaign, I designed a multi-week, interactive portal that hyped the product and educated  customer's about the  industry. The site evolved week-to-week, revealing new creative and stories as the launch date grew closer. In addition, my team shipped an entirely new shopping experience for the site that made it easier for customers to explore each fit and preview them across different body types.
