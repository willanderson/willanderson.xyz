intro: >-
  Denim was an entirely new category for Everlane, and one of the most ambitious
  campaigns I was involved in. The product took more than 2 years to develop,
  and the launch involved 4-months of prep, planning, and production to
  execute. 


  The campaign centered around a central message: Denim You Can Get Behind. The company sourced high-quality Japanese denim that typically retailed for double the price. We manufactured it at a cutting-edge factory in Vietnam that used substantially less waste than typical. And the styles felt both timeliness and relevant, with cuts that were flattering across a diverse range of body types. 


  To support the launch, I designed multi-week, interactive portal that both hyped the product and educated our customer's about the denim industry.  Along with housing 2 teaser commercials, the site evolved week-to-week, zooming out to reveal more details and story as the launch grew closer. In addition, my team shipped  an entirely new shopping experience for the e-commerce site (we called it Denim Shop). These updates made it easier for customers to explore our fits and preview them across different body types.
