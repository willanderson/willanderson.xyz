intro: While working with Coinbase's Identity team, I designed a new integrated
  ENS claim flow for Coinbase Wallet. This work spanned the wallet Chrome
  extension, iOS wallet app, and Coinbase's retail app. The implementation
  marked a significant milestone for users, enabling them to personalize their
  wallets and enhance P2P payments with a complimentary, easily understandable
  ENS domain.
