preview: A new identity for crypto wallets
intro: While working with Coinbase's Identity team, I led the design for an
  integrated ENS claim flow. This work spanned the wallet Chrome extension, iOS
  wallet app, and Coinbase's retail app. The implementation marked a significant
  milestone for users, enabling them to personalize their wallets and enhance
  P2P payments with a complimentary, easily understandable ENS domain.
