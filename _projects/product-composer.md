    text: The legacy creation tool (above) was hacked together on top of the blog tool, and was over 6-years old. After talking to users and auditing the flow, the team identified some key concerns

    text: I made it a priority to simplify the IA. The end result was a vertically stacked layout with intuitive groupings, clearer section headers, and an order that mapped back to how our users talked and thought about their products.

    text: To simplify things, we progressivley disclosed certain fields. For
      example, the field for adding a discounted price only appeared after
      the user marked the product to On Sale.

    text: The legacy composer had a ton of functuonality built into it which we
      had to support. In order to keep the default composer as simple as
      possible, I reframed this hodpdge of features as "add-ons" that could
      be enabled from one section.

    text: Another big milestone in the project was the new flow for creating and
      managing product variants. In the legacy tool, each product variation
      had to be manually created on a SKU by SKU basis. The Product Composer
      allowed users to bulk generate SKUs in a single click. We also had a
      nifty little preview on web.

    text: The composer was designed modularly. Sections within the tool could be
      hidden, emphasized, or moved around based on the type of product the
      user was creating (e.g. Physical or Digital). This approach made
      porting designs across device types a breeze.
