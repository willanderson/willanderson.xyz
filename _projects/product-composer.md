preview: An easier way to create and manage your products
intro: At Squarespace, I led a project to redesign the product creation flowâ€”a
  core experience that users interacted with on a weekly (sometimes daily)
  basis. The goal was to radically simplify how users managed their online
  inventory, and create a seamless editing experience across web and mobile.

    text: The legacy creation tool (above) was hacked together on top of the blog
      tool, and was over 6-years old. After talking to users and auditing the
      flow, the team identified some key concerns

    text: I made it a priority to simplify the IA. The end result was a vertically
      stacked layout with intuitive groupings, clearer section headers, and an
      order that mapped back to how our users talked and thought about their
      products.

    text: To simplify things, we progressivley disclosed certain fields. For
      example, the field for adding a discounted price only appeared after the
      user marked the product to On Sale.

    text: The legacy composer had a ton of functuonality built into it which we had
      to support. In order to keep the default composer as simple as possible, I
      reframed this hodpdge of features as "add-ons" that could be enabled from
      one section.

    text: Another big milestone in the project was the new flow for creating and
      managing product variants. In the legacy tool, each product variation had
      to be manually created on a SKU by SKU basis. The Product Composer allowed
      users to bulk generate SKUs in a single click. We also had a nifty little
      preview on web.

    text: The composer was designed modularly. Sections within the tool could be
      hidden, emphasized, or moved around based on the type of product the user
      was creating (e.g. Physical or Digital). This approach made porting
      designs across device types a breeze.
