preview: An easier way to create and manage your products
intro: At Squarespace, I led a comprehensive redesign of the product creation
  flow, a core interface our users engaged with frequentlyâ€”ranging from daily to
  weekly usage. The aim was to dramatically streamline the process for managing
  online inventory and ensure a fluid editing experience on both web and mobile
  platforms.

    text: Originally, the product creation tool was hacked together atop the
      existing Blog post composer, leading to various inconsistencies and
      challenges. These issues significantly complicated the product creation
      and editing process, making it both tedious and less intuitive.

    text: One of my primary objectives was to refine the tool's IA. The redesigned
      layout now features a clean, vertical stack with strategically organized
      sections and a logical sequence, improving user navigation and
      interaction.

      To further declutter the interface, we implemented progressive disclosure
      for specific fields. For instance, the option to add a discounted price
      now only becomes visible when a product is marked as 'On Sale,'
      simplifying the user's decision-making process.

    text: The original composer was laden with features that, while useful,
      overwhelmed the interface. My strategy involved reclassifying these
      numerous features into optional "add-ons," accessible from a unified
      section. This approach preserved functionality while maintaining a
      minimalist default interface.

    text: A significant breakthrough in our project was the overhaul of how product
      variants are created and managed. Previously, each variant required manual
      entry, a tedious process for users. The redesigned Product Composer now
      enables bulk generation of SKUs with a single click, accompanied by a
      convenient web preview feature.

    text: We designed the composer to be highly modular, allowing customization of
      sections according to the product type (e.g., Physical or Digital). This
      modularity not only facilitates easy adaptation across different devices
      but also personalizes the tool to the user's specific needs, streamlining
      the product creation experience.

    text: "The second milestone was porting over the designs to mobile. First, we
      integrated the new composer into the Commerce iOS app. Next, we added
      support for mobile web. "
