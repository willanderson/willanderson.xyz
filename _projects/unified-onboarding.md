preview: A unified onboarding framework
intro: >-
  I worked on a visual overhaul and unification of Coinbase's multi-product
  onboarding flows. We had to 2 goals: 
  
  First, establish a system for onboarding users which could be reused and relied on for Coinbase's vast product offerings. At the time, Coinbase offered 14 products, and s supported 12 distinct onboarding flows across web and mobile devices. 


  Next, uplevel the craft and quality of the flow by introducing a new visual style that aligned with Coinbase's recent rebrand.
