preview: A unified onboarding framework
intro: >-
  I worked on a visual overhaul and unification of Coinbase's multi-product
  onboarding flows. We had to 2 goals:  stablish a system for onboarding users
  which could be reused and relied on for Coinbase's vast product offerings. At
  the time, Coinbase offered 14 products, and s supported 12 distinct onboarding
  flows across web and mobile devices. 


  Next, uplevel the craft and quality of the flow by introducing a new visual style that aligned with Coinbase's recent rebrand.
