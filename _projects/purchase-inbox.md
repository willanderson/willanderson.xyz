preview: A new way to purchase art.
intro: >-
  Artwork can be purchased on Artsy through two different methods: the first is
  a standard e-commerce flow, and the second involves an inquiry system that
  enables collectors to directly message galleries.


  While collectors valued the personalized and interactive nature of the latter option, we also received feedback that the process could sometimes feel burdensome, time-consuming, or daunting. Upon reviewing user engagement, we discovered a considerable number of users were abandoning the inquiry purchase funnel.


  I worked on a redesigned flow that reduced upfront friction and created a more personalized exchange between buyer and seller.
