preview: "Revamping Artsy's Inquiry System "
intro: >-
  Artwork on Artsy can be acquired in two ways: through a conventional
  e-commerce transaction or via an inquiry system that lets collectors
  communicate directly with galleries.


  While the personal touch of the inquiry system is valued by collectors, feedback indicated that it could sometimes be unwieldy, lengthy, or daunting. An analysis of user engagement revealed that many were opting out of the inquiry purchase route.


  My efforts centered on enhancing this experience, specifically honing in on the initial inquiryâ€”the inaugural message a user sends to a gallery.
