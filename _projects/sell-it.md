preview: eCommerce without a website
intro: Aï»¿s part of a Hack week project, I worked with a small engineering team
  to design and build a concept app aimed at first-time sellers. Inspired by
  merchants who primarily sold products through social media and private
  messaging, we wanted to design a tool that supported expressive online selling
  without the need for a store or website.
