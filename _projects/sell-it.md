preview: eCommerce without a website
intro: As part of a Hack week project, I worked with a small engineering team to
  design and build a concept app aimed at first-time sellers. Inspired by
  merchants who primarily sold products through social media and private
  messaging, we wanted to design a tool that supported  online selling without
  the need for a store or website.

      users can easily understand how to use the app to start selling
      immediately. "

    text: The app features a minimalist product creation tool, enabling users to set
      up products in seconds. This functionality is central to the app, designed
      with the idea that less is more, allowing users to focus on what they're
      selling rather than how to sell it.

      Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, our app uses a unique approach by
      hosting each product with a single URL. This method streamlines the
      selling process, making it easier for users to share their products and
      reach potential buyers without the complexity of managing a store or
      website.

    text: With social media integration, the app makes it effortless for users to
      share their products on various platforms. This feature leverages the
      power of social networks, facilitating product discovery and purchase
      through familiar channels, simplifying the distribution process.
